In this repository i'll be uploading all the exercises that I do on Java.
They are divided into different folders according to the methodology used to solve the exercise.
At the moment, I already worked with: Collections, OOP, Iheritance, Interface, Polymoprhism, Class Relationships, UML Diagrams.

All of these exercises are from the bootcamp that i'm doing thanks to Globant on the Egg platform.
